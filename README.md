When negated, some verbs (like "want" or "believe") imply the negation of their complementing verb. For instance, "I do not believe that John left" is interpreted as "I believe that John didn't leave". Fot other verbs, it is impossible ("I do not hope that John left" does not mean "I hope that John did not leave"). However, this inference (it is called Neg-Raising) may depend not only on the very verb, but on other factors as well, like the person of the subject, tense, and other morphosyntactic features.

In this project, based on MegaNegRaising dataset analysis (http://megaattitude.io/projects/mega-negraising/), I am trying to find out if it is possible to predict the Neg-Raising inference given the verb and the range of grammatical features (spoiler: given the rarity of this feature, it is quite hard for traditional ML algorithms).
